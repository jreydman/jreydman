<h2 class="font-semibold text-2xl lg:text-3xl">Interests</h2>

<br />

<ul class="[&>li]:my-2">
  <li>
    I leaf through anything I can get my hands on, but I usually prefer
    journalism and documentation on circuitry and hardware systems.
  </li>
  <li>I also have a unique hobby, which is learning</li>
  <li>
    I'm not attracted to autobiographical topics and psychology because I think
    it's sophistry and a waste of time. In my spare time, I hang out on
    benchmarks for new developments and chat with coworkers.
  </li>
</ul>
